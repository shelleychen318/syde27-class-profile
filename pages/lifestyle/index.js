          On average, SYDE students spend 4.9 hours studying and 6.1 hours
          sleeping. Shoutout to the 5 students who dedicate 9-10 hours per day
          to studying, y'all are the true embodiment of the "rise and grind"
          mentality!

            Data was collected on the stress levels of students during their 1A
            term and their first co-op term. The stress levels were rated on a
            scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicated little to no stress and 5
            indicated high stress.
            <br />
            <br />
            In general, students experienced lower levels of stress during their
            co-op term compared to their 1A term, as the average stress level
            during 1A was 3.8, while the average stress level during co-op was
