          Information about our high school academics and extracurriculars, as
          well as university applications.

        <h3>High School Admission Average</h3>
        <div className={styles.doubleChart}>
          <Chart type="histogram" data={averageData} layout="double" />
          <p className={styles.textRight}>
            The admission average is based on a student's top 6 courses in grade
            12, rounded to the nearest whole number. The SYDE 2027 cohort had an
            overall average of 96.3%.
            <br />
            <br />
            This surpasses the competitive benchmark of "high 80s to low 90s"
            stated on the admissions website, indicating an increase in
            competition to get into the program in recent years.

        <h3>Enrichment Programs</h3>
        <p>
          The majority of the class (86%) was involved in some sort of
          enrichment program in high school.

        <h3>Extracurriculars</h3>
        <p>
          We participated in a wide range of extracurricular activities in high
          school, among which sports emerged as the most popular. Looks like
          SYDE 2027 has some athletes among us!

        <div className={styles.doubleChart}>
          <p className={styles.textLeft}>
            As many would expect, the most popular alternate university choice
            was UofT, with McMaster coming in at a close second.
            <br />
            <br />
            Despite having offers from many prestigious schools in Canada and
            the United States, we ultimately decided to pursue SYDE at Waterloo!

            84% of us said that SYDE was our top choice, while 16% had their
            hearts set on a different program. It's okay, we still love you ðŸ˜”

          For those of us who said SYDE was not our top choice, these are the
          programs we were striving for in high school.

        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p>
          Some insight on how high school influenced our SYDE experience. Most
          of us decided we wanted to be part of the SYDE gang in our final year
          of high school, but one person has had their heart set on SYDE before
          even entering grade 9!
